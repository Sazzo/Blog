Hi! I am honored that you were interested in me to the point of reading about, anyway, my name is Felipe and I have the name of Sazz here on the internet, I am 13 years old weeb and a programmer based in Brazil, Bahia! ðŸ˜Š

I have a passion for bots on Discord, backend and creative stuff! I am always looking to learn new cool things and meet new people!

I'm the developer of Ritsu, a bot on Discord based on the game AnimeMusicQuiz, I made the website that simulates a ban of several bots (also on Discord), I have already made a platform LoFI's in VueJS called streamLofi and among other things!

I sell commissions on some little things related to Discord (like bots) and I'm always working on something new.

It is! Have a fun project? Send me on Discord or Email that I would love to have a look at or even contribute to! See you ðŸ’–
